# For the Public Good

We believe the world's search engines should place the public good above monetization. Let us reiterate, we are not against monetization - we believe those who labor deserve compensation for their work, even abundant compensation. But this compensation cannot come at the detriment of the public good.

Many companies would claim to operate for the public good. Google was famously known for its "Do no evil" slogan, but many would say that Google has done evil. We do not feel the need to demonize Google, only to say that we believe there is signficant opportunity for improvement.

We believe that a search engine company could ensure it operated for the public good over monetization by:

1. Establishing robust external oversight by trusted third parties.\[1\]
2. Making the aggregate search data \(e.g. without personal user information\) openly available such that it could be "forked" at any time to create a new, entirely separate search engine.
3. Establishing a strong privacy-by-default policy.
4. Providing the algorithm of the search engine as free and open source.\[2\]
5. Setting constraints on the compensation available to management based on the compensation to the lowest paid employee.
6. Committing to the long-term holding of the search engine and not an attempt to grow and sell.\[3\]

In addition to behaving well as an organization we believe there would be tangible benefits from a search engine such as we are proposing. For example:

1. Returning quality results improves the productivity of individuals seeking to make the world a better place.
2. Using our algorithm we will be able to significantly reduce the quantity of bad actors able to rank in our results over traditional search engines. This will help keep all of us safer, especially those who may be most vulnerable to deception.
3. By providing tools that can be used in research generally, including by academia, to expedite projects and ensure higher quality output.
4. By providing an opportunity for \(some\) income generation to all individuals.
5. By modeling a corporate culture which emphasizes employee care, customer service, and social responsibility.

## Footnotes

\[1\] Organizations we would love to have \(but that have not been asked nor offered any endorsement to this project\) as part of that oversight committee might include: Mozilla Foundation, Creative Commons, Internet Archive, W3C, IETF. That is not to say we wouldn't also welcome involvement from commercial organizations, input from companies like Microsoft,  Google, IBM, etc. could be invaluable.  
\[2\] We will address concerns about potential exploitation of the algorithm by individuals/organizations later in this document. For the moment we will only note that the algorithm itself has uncontrollable aspects which while transparent make gaming results almost impossible.  
\[3\] Basecamp is a good example of a company which has grown greatly but also sought to maintain ownership rather than being acquired.

# Why the World Needs Another Search Engine

We, the people of the world, use web search in our lives pervasively. What we find via web search has the potential to significantly impact our lives for good or evil.

Currently, web search is controlled almost entirely by a single company: [Google](https://google.com/) \([92.51%](https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share)\). There are other players in web search but the difference in market share makes it clear there are no real competitors for Google.\[1\]

Is this a bad thing? If so why?

## \(Lack of\) Privacy

New search engines with a privacy focus have been popping up with increased regularity. The amount of data Google retains on individual users has caused widespread concern.

## \(Lack of\) Competition

Usually we find that companies improve their products and services with increased competition. A single company dominating an entire market sector oftentimes results in mediocre products and services.

Draconian measures are often enforced by this monopolistic entity as individuals have no alternative to utilize.

## Commercialization of the Web

We are for folks working and seeing good returns \(monetarily\) on their labor. However, we are opposed to monetization which occurs at significant detriment to the public good.

Many question the appropriateness of paid search engine ads that provide those with the greatest financial resources the ability to dominate searcher's attention. We agree that this topic needs consideration although it is not our primary concern.

We find more concerning the way organic search results are being ranked by financial resources. That is, if an individual/organization has significant financial resources these resources can be used in SEO/SEM endeavors that ensure their resources appear first in the search results.

Sure, the search engines change their algorithms frequently to help diminish the worst offenders' ability to game search results BUT these algorithms generally have minimal effect on less egregious offenders.

## Suppression of New Material

This is not an intentional endeavor by search engines to suppress new sites with new material. Rather it is a result of the algorithms used to calculate search result rankings.

Sites which have existed for a longer period of time and/or have a large number of incoming, high quality links have a significant advantage over newer sites -- even if those new sites have much better/reliable materials.

This discourages many who create content on the web as their beautiful work goes unappreciated. Sites are often abandoned long before they appear highly in the search results.

## \(Poor Quality\) Search Results

The results returned by search engines have improved significantly over prior engines but are still absymal in so many cases. For example, take a look at the first page of results for any of the following queries:

1. "History of Search Engines"
   1. Many of the results are not about search engines properly but about search engine optimization.
   2. The content of the results is often fairly brief and of poor quality.
2. "Best {Product/Service}" \(e.g., refrigerator, laptop, bed, headphones\)
   1. Who is writing these reviews? Are they by people who have actually trialed the product or are they optimized for revenue through affiliate links?
   2. Are the reviews just a compilation of what has been said in reviews on Amazon.com?
   3. The reviews are often quite long but the relevant content is often brief and buried within fluff that helps the pages rank high on the search engine.
3. Any highly specific technical error message
   1. Oftentimes, the results include numerous feed sites - that is, sites that simply scrape the conversations/information from other sites.
   2. You can end up reading the same content from five or six sites before finding more unique content.
4. "CNN" or "Fox News" or "{Organization Name}"
   1. Notice how not only the organization's site is present but also other sites that syndicate the first organization's content.
   2. Wouldn't there be better results than showing almost exclusively the organization's own content?

## \(Lack of\) Improvements to Searcher Productivity

Finally, search engines lack many simple and intuitive tools that could significantly improve searcher's productivity. For example:

* Relatively limited qualifiers for refining searches.
* Inability to filter out or prioritize in certain results for specific queries.
* Inability to share natively one's own research on a topic with others.

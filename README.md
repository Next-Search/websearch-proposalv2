# Introduction

The world needs another and better web search engine. Full stop.

In this document we will explain why another search engine is needed and how this search engine would differentiate itself from other web search engines.

In addition, we will document why we believe this search engine is different and better enough to actually challenge Google's search supremacy.

We are eager to hear your thoughts, criticisms, suggestions, etc. Please share them with us! You can [submit comments, issues, and corrections to our GitHub repository](https://github.com/nextsearch/websearch-proposalv2). In addition we can be reached by email at [nextsearch@protonmail.com](mailto:nextsearch@protonmail.com) or on Twitter: [@nextwebsearch](https://twitter.com/nextwebsearch).
